## Dataset Preparation

2 datasets were combined in order to enhance the model performance as each of the provided datasets did not display an outstanding performance when considered individually. The datasets used were <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013"> FER-2013 </a> & <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilkushsingh/facial-emotion-dataset"> Facial Emotion Dataset </a>, both publicly available and recognized datasets on <a href="kaggle.com"> Kaggle </a>.
