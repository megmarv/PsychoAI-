# Dataset Preparation

Two datasets were combined in order to enhance the model performance as each of the provided datasets did not display an outstanding performance when considered individually. The datasets used were <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013"> FER-2013 </a> & <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilkushsingh/facial-emotion-dataset"> Facial Emotion Dataset </a>, both publicly available and recognized datasets on <a href="kaggle.com"> Kaggle </a>. Several steps were taken to combine these datasets manually.

## FER-2013
