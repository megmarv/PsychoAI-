# Custom Convolutional Neural Network

Two datasets were combined in order to enhance the model performance as each of the provided datasets did not display an outstanding performance when considered individually. The datasets used were <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013"> FER-2013 </a> & <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilkushsingh/facial-emotion-dataset"> Facial Emotion Dataset </a>, both publicly available and recognized datasets on <a href="kaggle.com"> Kaggle </a>. Several steps were taken to combine these datasets manually. SHA-256 was used for removing duplicates within the new dataset and all classes for the training directory were balanced using augmentation where necessary.
