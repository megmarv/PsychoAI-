  ResNETv50 - Test
  <br>
</h1>

This Branch is dedicated entirely for the ResNETv50 model and the components used to aid the model. The ResNET model was imported and enhanced in order to identify more complex features consistently. After several months of dedication, it was concluded that this model was decent but did not perform as expected, thus moving onto exploring other options in <a href="https://github.com/megmarv/PsychoAI-/tree/Emotion-Identification3">Emotion-Identification3</a>
